### A cross-modality AI framework for ecological habitat reconstruction from histopathology

**CANVAS** (***C**ellular **A**rchitecture and **N**eighborhood-informed **V**irtual **A**I-driven **S**patial-reconstruction*) is a biologically grounded, cross-modality AI framework that integrates high-dimensional spatial proteomics with routine histopathology to reconstruct, quantify, and model tumor ecological habitats directly from H&E-stained tissue sections. By learning to transfer CODEX-defined cellular neighborhoods (CNs) onto native histology, CANVAS enables accurate and scalable inference of spatial habitats across whole-slide images. This cross-modality alignment is powered by visionâ€“language foundation modeling, refined through AI-agentâ€“guided biological interpretation, and optimized via efficient spatial feature selection and machine learningâ€“based prognostic modeling. Spanning single-cell resolution to population-scale clinical inference, CANVAS builds a functional bridge between spatial biology and precision oncology, enabling interpretable and translatable spatial biomarker discovery.

### ðŸ”§ Key Modules

#### (1) CN-to-habitat prediction via a visionâ€“language foundation model

CANVAS employs a foundation model trained on paired CODEXâ€“H&E whole-slide data to infer CN-defined ecological habitats directly from unannotated histology. This module integrates:

- Visual context derived from high-resolution H&E morphology
- *(Optional)* Language-driven semantic priors encoding CN-specific composition, functions, and immune roles *(modular but not used in current version)*
- Contrastive supervision across CODEXâ€“histology habitat pairs to ensure spatial and biological correspondence

**Run:**

```bash
python do_CANVAS.py
```

**Output:** Patch-level probability maps of predicted habitat classes across whole-slide H&E images.

#### (2) Habitat-level spatial feature generation

For each inferred habitat, CANVAS extracts a suite of biologically interpretable spatial features spanning six domains:

- **Composition:** Cell-type abundance, immuneâ€“stromal partitioning
- **Diversity:** Shannon index, Fisher alpha, richness, entropy
- **Spatial metrics:** Ripleyâ€™s K/L/F functions, Clarkâ€“Evans index, kernel density
- **Interaction:** Cellâ€“cell proximity networks, motif embeddings, barrier scores
- **Distance:** Intercellular distance matrices stratified by immune lineage
- **Transition entropy:** Non-Euclidean metrics of spatial heterogeneity and boundary complexity

**Run:**

```bash
Rscript do_feature_generation.R
```

**Output:** Multiscale spatial feature matrices per sample.

#### (3) Feature selection and prognostic modeling

To identify clinically meaningful spatial biomarkers, CANVAS performs:

- Bootstrap LASSO and RandomForestSRC for feature stability and importance
- Univariate Cox regression for interpretable survival association
- Multivariate modeling across cohorts for outcome prediction
- Subtype stratification across histologic and mutational subclasses (e.g., LUAD vs LUSC, EGFR/KRAS)

**Run:**

```bash
Rscript do_feature_modeling.R
```

**Output:** Refined biomarker panels and risk prediction models for immunotherapy outcomes.

#### (4) AI-agent guidance and spatial explainability

CANVAS incorporates an AI-agent module to enhance interpretability by linking spatial features to their cellular and topological origins. Specifically, the agent:

- Maps high-level features (e.g., STE, Ripleyâ€™s K) to cellular composition and topology
- Highlights immuneâ€“stromal segregation, fibrotic barriers, and lymphoid clustering
- Prioritizes spatial configurations associated with immune exclusion and therapy resistance

**Run:**

```bash
python do_AI_agent.py
```

**Output:** A biologically coherent explanation layer linking model-derived features to spatial architecture.
