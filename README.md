### A cross-modality AI framework for ecological habitat reconstruction from histopathology

**CANVAS** (***C**ellular **A**rchitecture and **N**eighborhood-informed **V**irtual **A**I-driven **S**patial profiling*) is a biologically grounded, cross-modality AI framework that integrates high-dimensional spatial proteomics with routine histopathology to reconstruct, quantify, and model tumor ecological habitats directly from H&E-stained tissue sections. By learning to transfer CODEX-defined cellular neighborhoods (CNs) onto native histology, CANVAS enables accurate and scalable inference of spatial habitats across whole-slide images. This cross-modality alignment is powered by visionâ€“language foundation modeling, refined through AI-agentâ€“guided biological interpretation, and optimized via efficient spatial feature selection and machine learningâ€“based prognostic modeling. Spanning single-cell resolution to population-scale clinical inference, CANVAS builds a functional bridge between spatial biology and precision oncology, enabling interpretable and translatable spatial biomarker discovery.

### ðŸ”§ Key Modules

#### (1) CN-to-habitat prediction via a visionâ€“language foundation model

CANVAS leverages a visionâ€“language foundation model trained on paired CODEX and H&E whole-slide images to infer CN-defined ecological habitats directly from unannotated histology. This module integrates:

- Visual context extracted from high-resolution H&E morphology
- *(Optional)* Language-driven semantic priors encoding CN-specific composition, cell phenotyes, and functional roles *(modular, not enabled in the current version)*
- Contrastive supervision across CODEXâ€“histology habitat pairs to ensure spatial and biological correspondence
- Cross-modality co-registration at single-cell resolution to anchor CODEX-defined CNs within histologic context

**Run:**

```bash
python do_registration.py
python train_CANVAS.py
```

**Output:** Patch-level maps of predicted habitat classes across whole-slide H&E images.

#### (2) Habitat-level spatial feature generation

For each inferred habitat, CANVAS extracts a suite of biologically interpretable spatial features spanning six categories:

- **Composition:** Quantifies the relative abundance of each spatial habitat within the tissue section
- **Diversity:** Measures habitat heterogeneity using metrics such as Shannon index, Fisherâ€™s alpha, and richness
- **Spatial dispersion:** Captures habitat-level spatial organization using Ripleyâ€™s K, L, and F functions, Clarkâ€“Evans index, and kernel density
- **Interaction:** Quantifies pairwise spatial relationships between habitats using permutation-based analysis
- **Distance:** Computes directional Euclidean distances between habitat pairs
- **Transition entropy:** Non-Euclidean metrics reflecting the internal complexity and interfacial dynamics of the spatial architecture

**Run:**

```bash
Rscript Feature_generation/Spatial_metrics.R
```

**Output:** Multiscale spatial feature matrices per sample.

#### (3) Feature selection and prognostic modeling

To identify clinically meaningful spatial biomarkers, CANVAS performs:

- Bootstrap LASSO and RandomForestSRC for feature stability and importance
- Univariate Cox regression for interpretable survival association
- Multivariate modeling across cohorts for immunotherapy outcome prediction

**Run:**

```bash
Rscript Feature_selection_modeling/feature_selection_modeling.R
```

**Output:** Refined biomarker panels and risk prediction models for immunotherapy outcomes.

#### (4) AI-Agent module for spatial feature interpretation

CANVAS incorporates a large language model (LLM)-driven AI agent to facilitate the systematic interpretation of high-dimensional spatial features by linking them to underlying spatial biology and relevant clinical priors.

The agent generates structured, human-interpretable outputs across five key biological dimensions:

- (i) Feature category
- (ii) Characteristic cellular composition of the associated habitat
- (iii) Description of the encoded spatial property
- (iv) Tendency for topological coupling with other habitats
- (v) Potential biological and clinical relevance

**Run:**

```bash
python do_AI_agent.py
```

**Output:** An interpretable annotation layer that contextualizes model-derived spatial features within tissue architecture, ecological topology, and clinical significance.

### ðŸ”¬ Applications

- Immunotherapy response stratification in NSCLC and other solid tumors using spatially resolved habitat features
- Habitat-informed prognostic modeling across large-scale cohorts including TCGA, PLCO, and NLST
- Molecular subtyping independent of PD-L1 expression levels or canonical oncogenic mutations (e.g., EGFR, KRAS)
- Virtual spatial proteomic annotation directly inferred from standard H&E histology, enabling scalable tissue profiling without multiplex staining
